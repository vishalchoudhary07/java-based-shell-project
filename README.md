🚪 Exit the shell cleanly with exit

❌ Graceful handling of invalid commands and paths

🔧 Easily extensible for more commands
## Technologies Used
Java 22 – Core programming language used to build the shell

Java I/O (java.io.*) – For file and directory handling (type, cd)

Java NIO (java.nio.file.*) – For efficient path resolution (optional)
